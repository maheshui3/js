//three ways to create objects using literals, using factory, constructor
//initializing object using literals
const address = {
    street: "7-35/1 Chevvavari gudem",
    city: "Kalmalachervu",
    zipcode: "508201"
}

function showAddress (param) { 
    for(let key in param){
        console.log(key, param[key])
    }
}
showAddress(address);

//Initializing object using factory - uses camelcase notation
function address(st, city, code){
    return {
        street: st,
        city: city,
        zipcode: code
    }
}
const add = address('7-35/1', 'Kal', '508201');
console.log(add);

//Initializing object using constructor - uses pascal notation

function address(st, city, code){
        this.street= st,
        this.city= city,
        this.zipcode= code
}
const add = new address('7-35/1', 'Kal', '508201');
console.log(add);

//summary - factory return an object, where as constructor uses this keyword to create a new object, behind the scenes they both does same functionality.
